## 🌱 **Introduction**  
The **Crop Analysis and Recommendation System** is an **interactive, data-driven web application** designed to assist farmers and researchers in making informed decisions about crop selection and management. By leveraging **machine learning** and **dynamic visualizations**, the system provides personalized crop recommendations based on key environmental factors such as:

- 🌡️ **Temperature**  
- 💧 **Humidity**  
- 📏 **pH Level**  
- 🌧️ **Rainfall**  

In addition to recommending the most suitable crops, the system also offers **nutrient recommendations** for each crop, including essential elements like **Nitrogen (N)**, **Phosphorus (P)**, and **Potassium (K)**. These recommendations are tailored to the specific environmental conditions, helping farmers optimize **soil fertility** and ensure that crops receive the proper nutrients for healthy growth. 

This system aims to promote **sustainable farming practices** by combining crop selection with **precise nutrient management**, leading to improved crop yield, efficient resource use, and healthier soils.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
This project uses **machine learning** and interactive visualizations to predict the most suitable crop based on **temperature**, **pH**, **humidity**, and **rainfall**. It also recommends **fertilizer** suggestions to optimize soil health and crop growth.

### **Features:**  
1. 🌱 **Overall Crop Analysis**  
2. 🌾 **Individual Crop Insights**  
3. 🔍 **Crop Recommendation System**  
4. 🌟 **Feature Comparison Between Crops**

## 📊 **Features**  

### 🌱 **Overall Crop Analysis**  
- Analyze trends and summary statistics of crops.  
- Visualize **correlation matrices**, **boxplots**, and **animated feature distributions**.  

### 🌾 **Individual Crop Analysis**  
- Get optimum weather conditions (Temperature, pH, Humidity, Rainfall).  
- Analyze recommended fertilizers (N, P, K values).  
- Visualize boxplots and trends for selected crops.  

### 🔍 **Crop Recommendation**  
- Suggest the most suitable crop for your input conditions (temperature, pH, humidity, and rainfall).  
- **Nutrient Recommendations** for the suggested crop:
  - **Nitrogen (N)**: [Recommended value for crop]  
  - **Phosphorus (P)**: [Recommended value for crop]  
  - **Potassium (K)**: [Recommended value for crop]  
- **Similar Crops** that can be grown under similar conditions:
  - [Similar Crop 1]  
  - [Similar Crop 2]  
  - [Similar Crop 3] 

### 🌟 **Crop Comparison**  
- Compare key features of two crops using **interactive Radar Charts**.
